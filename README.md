# How to...

## Build and run this project
To make the developer experience as nice as possible, we use <a href="https://www.jetify.com/devbox" target="_blank">DevBox</a> and <a href="https://devcontainers.github.io" target="_blank">DevContainers</a>.
It should be as simple as this:
1. Start a new <a href="https://github.com/codespaces/new?hide_repo_select=true&ref=main&repo=1115772808&skip_quickstart=true&machine=standardLinux32gb&devcontainer_path=.devcontainer%2Fdevc[...]" target="_blank">GitHub Codespace</a>
1. Start a terminal and run your `devbox shell`. It will run automatically on codespaces.
1. Run `devbox services up` to start all application services (database, web server, proxy, ...).
1. Access the application, preferably on the URL https://local.env.daws25.com:10443/ to test locally with the same browser polocies regarding HTTPS and CORS.

Please open a discussion if you have any issues running this project.
